%^CYAN%^BOLD%^MAGICAL DEVICES%^RESET%^

Besides swinging your sword or casting spells, you can also use various magical
devices found in the world. There are two main types of magical devices:

%^CYAN%^BOLD%^SCROLLS:%^RESET%^
Scrolls are spells that have been stored on parchment for later use. These are
one-time use items and the scroll is consumed after the spell is cast.
Characters with the Scribe feat can create new scrolls with spells they have
memorized.

As a general rule, a player may use a scroll spell that exists in their class's
spell list with no penalties, provided they actually meet the requirements for
casting the spell. Players may use a scroll from ANOTHER class's spell list
but at great risk of failing the spell and losing the scroll. The chances to
avoid failure are based on the player's intelligence stat and spellcraft
skill. Be warned, however, that this failure chance will always be fairly high.

Thieves and Bards with the Use Magic Device feat may also attempt to use a
scroll, with success or failure based on their intelligence (charisma for bards)
stat and overall thief or bard level compared against the scroll's caster level
and level of the spell being cast. Bards may still cast scrolls from their own
spell list without this additional check.

%^CYAN%^BOLD%^WANDS:%^RESET%^
Wands are another magical item that casts spells. Unlike scrolls, wands tend to
have multiple uses, or charges. Wands are subject to the same rules as scrolls
in terms of which spells can be cast for no penalty. The off-class rolls for
using a wand are the same. Thieves with the Use Magical Device feat can also
use these devices with greater success.
