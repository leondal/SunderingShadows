Bards are great entertainers and tend to be enjoyable adventuring companions. They are lore-keepers and bringers of news from faraway lands. Some are well-respected, acting as the voice of nobles to their people and to other cities, and are known for maintaining a degree of neutrality in most matters. They get by on their wit and charm, and some are known as roguish troublemakers. 

They are flexible and dabble in many areas of combat, rather than being a master of one. They have a rogue's basic combat ability, as well as six levels of arcane spells. Their casting abilities are based upon their charisma score. They can also create and recite %^ORANGE%^<lore>%^RESET%^.

Bards are spontaneous casters that prepare spell levels in place of individual spells. They use the %^ORANGE%^<master>%^RESET%^ command to learn new spells from the bard spell list. See %^ORANGE%^<spells bard (by level)>%^RESET%^. They can %^ORANGE%^<cast>%^RESET%^ a spell they have mastered by expending a spell slot, which they can prepare with the %^ORANGE%^<prepare>%^RESET%^ command. To see how many slots you can prepare, use %^ORANGE%^<recall bard spells>%^RESET%^. 

Bards also get the following cantrip spells (type 'recall cantrip spells'):
Daze, Detect Magic, Dancing Lights, Mending, Flare, Resistance
