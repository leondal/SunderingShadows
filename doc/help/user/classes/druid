Druids are champions of nature, though they claim no power over it. Instead, a druid's power comes from being one with the natural world: Reveling in the awesome destructive power of a storm and finding strength in the gentle rejuvenating potential of a calm pool. Druids are a mixed lot, following the paths of various deities and even holding to diverse truths about the natural world. As such, any two druids may not see eye-to-eye on many matters, including the very essence of nature itself. Many druids prefer to be solitary.

Druids are versatile and they can take many paths in their lives: Powerful spellcasters, fearsome beasts or martial warriors. To learn how to take on the form of an animal, see %^ORANGE%^<help shapeshift>%^RESET%^. 

%^CYAN%^Druidic oaths:%^RESET%^ Druids train with natural weapons and armor, and they further take traditional oaths that restrict them from using metal armor. Druids avoid carrying much worked metal at all, believing that it interferes with the pure nature of the wilds. The reasoning behind these oaths depends on the druid's background.

Druids prepare individual spells with the %^ORANGE%^<prepare>%^RESET%^ command from the druid spell list, which you can view with the %^ORANGE%^<spells druid (by level)>%^RESET%^ command. They can cast prepared spells with the %^ORANGE%^<cast>%^RESET%^ command. To see which spells you have prepared, use %^ORANGE%^<recall druid spells>%^RESET%^. To remove a spell from the list, use the %^ORANGE%^<forget>%^RESET%^ command. 

They may choose one domain from the following list: %^GREEN%^BOLD%^air, animal, cold, earth, fire, plant, renewal%^RESET%^. The spells from that domain are added to their list of available spells and can be prepared normally.

Druids also get the following cantrips (type 'recall cantrip spells'):
Create Water, Detect Magic, Detect Poison, Guidance, Resistance, Light, Mending

They can cast in any armor they can wear, but not while wielding anything.
