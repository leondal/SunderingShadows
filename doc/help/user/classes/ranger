The ranger is a hunter and woodsman who lives by not only his sword or bow, but also his wits. Rangers, like nature itself, can be of any alignment. Their role and outlook changes depending upon their alignment, but they all have a few things in common. They are more comfortable in the wilderness than the city, and they have a strong affinity for nature that defines them.

Rangers have the basic combat skills of a warrior, as well as several other abilities to aid their survival. They gain lesser divine spells based on their wisdom score. They %^ORANGE%^<prepare>%^RESET%^ spells from the ranger spell list, which can be viewed with the %^ORANGE%^<spells ranger (by level)>%^RESET%^ command. They %^ORANGE%^<cast>%^RESET%^ the spell by expending a prepared spell from memory. To see which spells you have prepared, use %^ORANGE%^<recall ranger spells>%^RESET%^. To remove a spell from the list, use the %^ORANGE%^<forget>%^RESET%^ command.

Rangers can cast in any armor they can wear, but not while wielding anything.

%^BOLD%^Rangers can begin casting spells at level 6.%^RESET%^
