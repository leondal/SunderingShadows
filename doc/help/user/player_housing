Player housing is a good way for your character to leave a mark on the world. Players are encouraged to come up with good ideas and submit them, and keeping them limited in scope is the best way to get approved. Good ideas could be: A house in the woods, a garden of butterflies, or a small island with a few rooms.

RP will be prioritized for property locations. For instance, to build near the city of Shadow, the player will need to maintain proper relations with the city and be in good standing. Properties can be remodeled and added onto at a later date, do not feel the need to get a large sprawling property directly from the start. All properties need to have a physical entrance or means of entry in the sense of fairness - nowhere can be 100% isolated and inaccessible.

All prices are in gold coins.
